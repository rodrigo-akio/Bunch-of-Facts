*Bunch of Facts* is a simple app made with Flutter that displays 1000+ random fun facts. Every time you click the page, another random fact is displayed on the screen. 

The facts are stored in a string array and they are prefixed with 'r' to be used raw:
```dart
r'The scientific term for brain freeze is “sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia”.',
```

The array is imported to `main.dart` and is used in the TextButton Material Class using StatefulWidget to generate a random number and update the displayed text. 

The web app demo of this project is hosted with GitHub Pages, which can be located in the `gh-pages` branch. [Peanut](https://github.com/kevmoo/peanut.dart) was used to create a branch, build, and deploy the web app in the same GitHub project.
